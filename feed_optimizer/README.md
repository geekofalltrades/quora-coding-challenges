#Feed Optimizer

A pure Python implementation of the Feed Optimizer challenge.

This challenge superficially resembles the change-making problem: making
a certain amount of change using the fewest possible number of coins of
given denominations. That problem is solvable with a dynamic programming
approach, and so my first attempt at this problem will take a similar
approach.
