#Typeahead Search

A pure Python implementation of the Typeahead Search challenge.

Additions to this code could be a database for persistence, brokered through
a Python ORM like SQLAlchemy.

Another interesting note is that this particular challenge is
well-suited to the Prolog programming language.
